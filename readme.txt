How does it work?

This assumes that Your page is not fully integrated with HTML5's data properties for microdata. This plugin will create small code inside Your `full content`, with extra microdata from schema.org. This will be ONLY on singular pages - post, page or your custom post type.


Once we are on singular page:

# we will extract from it EXCERPT.
# If You haven't provided excerpt, plugin will look-up for post content, and downsize it to 170 symbols up to full word.
# If your content consist ONLY of shortcode, it will strip it out, and leave empty content. :(
# If we have empty content, from previous step, we will use post title. Not best choice, but at least we have some `description`.
# If Your post do not have even title, plugin will give up and your description will be empty. (This is very bad :') )

Other options, like `datePublished`, `dateModified` (if enabled), `UserComments` (if enabled), `url` are taken from post
