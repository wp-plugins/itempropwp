Add human invisible schema.org itemprop code to post content

== Description ==

This plugin is very simple. Using WordPress built in function to filter element attributes and adding < meta > tags with schema.org item properties.

[Project itempropWP homepage](http://simplemediacode.com/wordpress-pugins/itemprop-wp/?utm_source=http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/itempropwp/&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=itempropWP-WordPress-theme-feature-requests-3.3.6&utm_content=WordPress-plugin-itempropwp-3.3.6)

Example output:

`
<span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="itempropwp-wrap">
<!-- Itemprop WP 3.3.6 by Rolands Umbrovskis http://umbrovskis.com -->
 <meta itemprop="name" content="Title of the Article" />
 <meta itemprop="url" content="http://example.com/seo-optimized-article/" />
 <meta itemprop="image" content="http://example.com/images/example.jpg" />
 <meta itemprop="author" content="http://example.com/author/authorusername/"/>
 <meta itemprop="description" content="excerpt from post" />
 <meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2012-09-13 19:17:21" />
 <meta itemprop="dateModified" content="2012-09-29 13:33:25" />
 <meta itemprop="interactionCount" content="UserComments:356" />
<!-- Itemprop WP 3.3.6 by Rolands Umbrovskis http://umbrovskis.com end -->
</span>
`

How does it work?

This asumes that Your page is not fully integrated with HTML5's data properties for microdata. This plugin will create small code inside Your `full content`, with extra microdata from schema.org. This will be ONLY on singular pages - post, page or your custom post type.


Once we are on singular page:

# we will extract from it EXCERPT.
# If You haven't provided excerpt, plugin will look-up for post content, and downsize it to 170 symbols up to full word.
# If your content consist ONLY of shortcode, it will strip it out, and leave empty content. :(
# If we have empty content, from previous step, we will use post title. Not best choise, but at least we have some `description`.
# If Your post do not have even title, plugin will giveup and your description will be ampty. (This ir very bad :') )

Other options, like `datePublished`, `dateModified` (if enabled), `UserComments` (if enabled), `url` are taken from post
